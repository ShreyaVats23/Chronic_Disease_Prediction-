# Chronic Disease Prediction
This project applies machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of chronic diseases (e.g., diabetes, heart disease) using health and lifestyle data. The dataset includes demographic, lifestyle, and medical features such as age, BMI, blood pressure, smoking habits, exercise frequency, and more.

# Key Features

- Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values, encodes categorical variables, scales numeric features, and removes outliers.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizes age distribution, disease occurrence, BMI trends, and correlation heatmaps.
- Model Training: Implements multiple ML algorithms â€” Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, SVM, XGBoost, and AdaBoost.
- Hyperparameter Tuning: Uses GridSearchCV and class weighting to optimize performance and handle imbalanced data.
- Evaluation: Compares models with accuracy scores, confusion matrices, and classification reports.
- Prediction Demo: Tests the trained models on sample patient records.
